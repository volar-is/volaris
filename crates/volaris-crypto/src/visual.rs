//! This module offers visual functionality within `volaris-crypto`.
//!
//! It isn't rather populated, nor does `Volaris` itself use it, but the option is always there.
//!
//! This can be enabled with the `visual` feature, and you will notice a blue spinner on encryption and decryption - useful for knowing that something is still happening.
